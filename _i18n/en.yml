    lead_1: >
      Ten years after AR technology became popular, everyone can make videos easily, but it still feels difficult to produce AR content.
      Due to the expensive filming equipment and complex editing methods, AR content was perceived to be produced only by experts.
    lead_2: >
      FiguAR is creating a world where everyone produces AR content that is the main character in a reasonable price and convenient way.
      From the main character of the 3D game to virtual fitting of the online shopping mall, please look forward to the AR world that FiguAR will create.
